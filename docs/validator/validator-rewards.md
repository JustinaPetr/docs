# Validator Rewards

Validators in the Lava Protocol earn rewards through multiple mechanisms, including block rewards, delegation commissions, and incentives from RPC pools. These rewards are distributed based on network participation and validator performance.

1. Block Rewards
Validators and their delegators/restakers earn rewards for each successfully signed block.
Rewards are sourced from a reserve fund, allocated at 3.4% of the total LAVA supply.
2. Delegation Commission
Validators can set a commission rate on rewards earned by their delegators.
This commission is deducted before distributing rewards to delegators.
3. Provider Subscription Rewards
4.9% of total subscription revenue is allocated to Validators and their delegators.
These rewards are derived from user subscriptions to data services within the Lava ecosystem.
4. Incentivized RPC Pool Rewards
4.9% of RPC Pool rewards are distributed to Validators and their delegators.
RPC Pools consist of native tokens from blockchains deployed on Lava Network, providing additional incentives.

# Validator Delegation Program

Lava Foundation runs validator delegation program aimed to incentivize quality service for validators.

Delegation rounds occur every 6 months and are open to all existing and new Lava validators. Delegation rounds are usually announced on [Lava blog](https://www.lavanet.xyz/blog) and inclide the form that validators have to fill in to be considered for delegation.

Each delegation round includes a specific set of criteria that validators must meet in order to receive delegation. For example:

- Quality of Service (QoS): The reliability and performance of the validator.
- Technical Setup: The robustness and security of the validator’s infrastructure.
- Validator Contribution: Active involvement and contributions to the network.
- Marketing Impact: The validator’s ability and experience to promote and positively impact the ecosystem.

The number of eligible validators as well as the delegation amounts are determined for each validation round and are subject to change. It is aimed to secure the network, increase efficiency, and allow the market dynamics to flourish.

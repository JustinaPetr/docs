# The Lava Token 
## The Lava Toke Utility
The Lava Token, **$LAVA**, is the native asset of the Lava Network. The token serves multiple purposes, helping coordinate all network participants to provide fast, reliable, and permissionless data services. The Lava token is used for:

- Rewards for RPC providers, validators, and contributors  
- Gas fee payments  
- Governance (as a governance token), allowing token holders to participate in network decisions  
- Staking with validators to help secure the network and **restaking** to direct data traffic to top providers  

Lava has a fixed supply of tokens with no inflation. The total number of coins will never exceed **1,000,000,000 LAVA**.  

The Lava token is compatible with Cosmos wallets. **ÂµLAVA (or uLAVA)** is frequently used as a smaller unit (0.000001 LAVA) of the same denomination.



## Lava Mainnet Tokens vs Lava on Arbitrum
There are two Lava tokens available - a native Lava Mainnet token and Lava ERC20 token (available on Arbitrum). Two tokens enalbe Lava to be used within the Lava network as well as enable EVM chains to utilize Lava tokens for DeFi and other use cases.

- Lava Mainnet (native token) - enable Lava token to be used for staking, restaking and other network needs.
- Lava on Arbitrum (ERC20) - enable Lava token to be used on EVM chains for DeFi and other use cases.

## Restaking Lava tokens
Lava holders have the option to stake their tokens to validators and help secure the network while earning the yield from the validator's rewards. On top of that, stakers can delegate to providers to help direct traffic to quality RPC providers while earning additional yiled from provider's rewards.

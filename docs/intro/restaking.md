## Restaking

Lava token holders can stake their tokens to validators which helps secure the network and enables token holders to earn yield on their delegation. 

Restaking allows delegators (token holders who stake to validators) to maximize rewards while enhancing network security. It enables token holders to delegate tokens to a selected provider and claim a portion of the provider’s rewards.

Key restaking benefits:
- Helps delegators select high-performing providers.
- Increases yield for validator delegators.
- Reduces network security fees.


The credit mechanism in Lava ensures fair reward distribution to delegators based on both the amount and duration of their delegation. It calculates rewards proportionally to the effective stake over time.

## How Restaking Works

Restaking is eanbled using Lava's [dualstaking mechanism](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/tree/main/x/dualstaking#provider-delegation). Here's how it works:


- Validator Delegations → Restake to Providers: LAVA delegations to validators can be restaked to providers without requiring additional collateral, increasing rewards but also risks.

- Provider Delegations → Restake to Validators: When a provider stakes tokens, an equal amount is restaked to a validator. This, in turn, makes the provider's stake a self-stake as well as the delegation for a validator.


## How to stake and restake Lava
Lava staking and restaking for token holders is support on a few major wallet and staking platforms. Head to [How to stake and restake Lava](./how-to-stake-and-restake-lava.md) for a detailed overview and a guide on how to do it.

You are a provider, you will have an option to choose the validator you'd like to delegate to during the provider setup process.

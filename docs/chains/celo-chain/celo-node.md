# Running a Celo RPC Node

In order to run Celo RPC Node first you will have to start as a node operator. Follow the [official node setup guide](https://docs.celo.org/cel2/operators/run-node) on Celo documentation before continuing with the next steps.

:::note
Celo has recently migrated to L2. If you are still supporting Celo L1 nodes make sure to upgrade them using the [migration guide](https://docs.celo.org/cel2/operators/migrate-node).

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network ðŸŒ‹

Once your Celo node is up and running, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-celo-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=celo-pre-grant) to configure your provider service. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider service.

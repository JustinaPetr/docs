# Lava RPC
RPC is essential for interacting with blockchains â€” every interaction like trading, swapping, staking, even pulling the wallet banace are all RPC requests. Lava provides data consumers (AI agents, dapps, indexers, explorers, wallet, etc) with an easy way to access fast and ultra-reliable RPC.


## Consumer preferences and configurations
Data providers across various chains compete to deliver the highest-performing service. Consumers are directed to the most suitable providers based on service quality and their specific priorities. Depending on consumer requirements, configurations can be set to prioritize certain provider attributes, such as response latency, accuracy, availability, or broader strategies like distributing requests across multiple providers for enhanced privacy.



## Rate limits for Open Lava Endpoints
Lava providers developers with open endpoints that leverage Lava to dynamically route requests between different providers. They are open, free, and provide the data access at the rate of 3 req/s. 
Data cosumers can increase their usage limits and access different APIs by purchasing subscriptions using Lava native tokens.



## Subscriptions
Subscriptions in Lava are like passes that consumers buy to access different APIs. They let users reward providers and manage their access. Projects, on the other hand, are spaces within subscriptions where developers can organize and control resources. They help developers manage how they use computing power. Together, subscriptions and projects give users control and provide a flexible system for developers to work efficiently in the Lava ecosystem. 

Currently, subscriptions are a Beta feature. If you would like to purchase a subscription on Lava mainnet, reach out to the Lava team.
